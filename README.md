# custardsquare.exe

Gracie's public second brain disguised as a dreamy Windows 98 desktop.

Notes, thoughts, bugs, learnings, and little digital crumbs — published through a nostalgic desktop UI, powered by a reliable CMS underneath.

## Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js App Router
- **CMS:** Payload CMS 3
- **Database:** Neon Postgres via `@payloadcms/db-vercel-postgres`
- **Media:** Vercel Blob via `@payloadcms/storage-vercel-blob`
- **Hosting:** Vercel
- **Language:** TypeScript

## Local development

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Copy environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Fill in `.env` with your Neon `DATABASE_URL`, `PAYLOAD_SECRET`, and optional `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` (local fallback works without it).

4. Start the dev server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) for the public site.
6. Open [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin) to create your first admin user.

## Vercel production — media uploads

**Required for `/admin/collections/media` uploads on custardsq.app.**

Without `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`, Vercel cannot store files (the Blob adapter is disabled and serverless has no writable disk), which causes **500 errors** on upload.

1. Open your [Vercel project](https://vercel.com/dashboard) → **Storage** → **Create Database** → **Blob**
2. Name the store (e.g. `custardsquare-media`) and **connect it to this project**
3. Vercel adds `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` to Production (and Preview) automatically
4. **Redeploy** (Deployments → … → Redeploy, or push to `main`)

After redeploy, uploads go to `blob.vercel-storage.com` and the admin Media UI should work.

## Project philosophy

Build the content system first. Then build the desktop. Then add magic.

The desktop is how people discover the brain. The CMS is how Grace keeps feeding it.
